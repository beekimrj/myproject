<h3> Welcome</h3>
<p>
	Welcome to Hope Community Church, which began
	in 1988 with just nine people meeting in our living room!
	Since then, Hope has grown from strength to
	strength, with one of the hallmarks being the incredible
	commitment of hundreds of men and women, of all ages,
	cultures, and walks of life – all of whom are committed to
	seeing people’s lives transformed by the power of God’s
	love. It’s been an incredible journey so far, but as we look
	to the future, we’re convinced the best is yet to come!

	Together we are learning to live life the way Jesus did: knowing the Father loves us, empowered by the Holy Spirit, caring for each other, celebrating creativity, being adventurous in our faith, reaching out to those around, living honestly and devoted to God our Father.

	Hope Church has grown to be a diverse community of people from all different ages, stages and walks of life.
